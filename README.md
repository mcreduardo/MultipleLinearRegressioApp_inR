### Multiple Linear Regressio Application

<a href="https://mcreduardo.shinyapps.io/linearregression/" target="_blank">--->>> Run app on browser <<<---</a>

This is an application made in R that allows the user to do Multiple Linear Regression without any knowledge of programming. The app has a graphical interface made with the package Shiny. The regression is made by simply uploading a txt file with the data and defining a regression formula with any variables contained in that file. 

The application provides: 

* Summary with all fitted coeffients and respective t statistics;
* R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub> and BIC of model;
* ANOVA table with f statistics;
* Residual plots: res vs fitted, QQ plot, leverage, Cook's distance;
* Multicolinearity analysis: VIF, correlation, and correlation plots;
* Model selection with analylis of nested models by R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub> and BIC.
